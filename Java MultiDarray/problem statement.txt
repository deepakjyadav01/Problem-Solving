Take 2D matrix A of size N X M as an input and print M integers denoting the column-wise sum of each of the M columns.


Problem Constraints

1 <= N, M <= 103

1 <= A[i][j] <= 100


Input Format

First line contains two space-separated integers N and M.

Each of the next N lines contains M space-separated integers denoting the matrix elements.


Output Format

Print M space-separated integers where each denoting the column-wisw sum of A.


Example Input

Input 1:

 3 4
 3 2 1 3
 1 2 3 4
 4 3 1 2

Example Output

Output 1:

 8 7 5 9

Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Sum of elements of first column : 3 + 1 + 4 = 8
 Sum of elements of second column : 2 + 2 + 3 = 7
 Sum of elements of third column : 1 + 3 + 1 = 5
 Sum of elements of fourth column : 3 + 4 + 2 = 9
